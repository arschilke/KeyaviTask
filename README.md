# Keyavi Coding Assessment

## Usage

```shell
KeyaviTask.exe  4 2 8 5 8 3 1 12 #list of integers delimited by a space
```

Using your strongest coding language, please send back a code method that returns the 3rd largest element in a list.

Tips:
You do not need to implement a sorting algorithm. We encourage you to consider other designs that might be more optimal than sorting, if any. Also, if there are any tradeoffs, please document that in your code.
